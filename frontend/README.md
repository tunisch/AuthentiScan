# AuthentiScan: Prototype UI

This is the experimental frontend for the AuthentiScan project. Built on **Next.js 14**, it provides an interface to demonstrate the lifecycle of a **Verification Record** on the **Stellar Testnet**.

## Interface Objectives (Prototype)

- **Workflow Visualization:** Prototype indicators and meters for visualizing **Prototype AI Analysis** data.
- **Blockchain Interface:** Interaction logic for anchoring **SHA-256 Content Hashes** to the ledger via Stellar SDK and Freighter Wallet.
- **Record Telemetry:** Basic transaction state monitoring (Signing → Broadcasting → Confirming).
- **Modern Layout:** Clean, accessible interface designed for demonstration and peer feedback.

---

## Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Engine:** React & TypeScript
- **Styling:** Modular CSS & React Components
- **SDK Integration:** `@stellar/stellar-sdk` & `@stellar/freighter-api`
- **Identity Logic:** Local **SHA-256 Content Hash** generation using the Web Crypto API.

## Setup & Execution

### 1. Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file in the `/frontend` directory:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID=YOUR_TESTNET_CONTRACT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
```

### 2. Launch Development Server
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Validation Procedures

The frontend includes validation scripts to ensure the consistency of cryptographic operations and state logic.

```bash
# Run validation scripts
node tests/validate.mjs
```

**Key Verification Areas:**
- **Identity Determinism:** Ensuring the **SHA-256 Content Hash** remains consistent for identical files.
- **Lifecycle Integrity:** Validating the data flow from file ingest to **Verification Record** anchor.
- **Mock Alignment:** Verifying UI response to **Prototype AI Analysis (Simulated)** data.

---

## Prototype Disclosures

- **Data Privacy**: All hashing is performed locally. Only the **SHA-256 Content Hash** and analysis metadata are transmitted.
- **Analytical Disclosure**: The forensic indicators are currently generated by a **Prototype AI Analysis module** and are not real-time detection results.
- **Environment**: This UI is designed and configured for the **Stellar Testnet**.
