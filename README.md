AuthentiScan is an industrial-grade **"Truth Anchor"** platform that converges **Advanced AI Diagnostics** with **Stellar Blockchain Immutability** to verify and secure video authenticity.

## 💎 Core Pillars

- **🛡️ AI Forensic Diagnostics:** Multi-modal analysis covering spatial anomalies, temporal stability, and spectral audio consistency.
- **🔗 Cryptographic Anchoring:** Every verification record generates a unique SHA-256 fingerprint anchored to the Stellar Testnet.
- **⏳ Immutable Audit Trail:** Once a record is broadcasting to the ledger, it becomes a permanent, tamper-proof record of truth.
- **👁️ Transparency First:** Integrated explorer telemetry allows anyone to verify the provenance of a video independently.

## 🛠️ How it Works (Interactive Flow)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Video Selection] --> B[Client-Side Hashing]
    B --> C[Neural Engine Analysis]
    C --> D[Diagnostic Metadata Generation]
    D --> E[Stellar Ledger Anchor]
    E --> F[Immutable Audit Log]
    F --> G[Public Verification Proof]
```

### 1. Verification Journey
1.  **Ingestion:** Select a video (locally or via URL). The system performs client-side ingestion with no raw media transmission. The file remains entirely within your browser environment.
2.  **Diagnostics:** AI models scan for pixel jitters and spectral deviations.
3.  **Anchoring:** Sign a transaction via **Freighter Wallet** to store results on-chain.
4.  **Audit:** Retrieve clinical-grade proof from the Stellar Network at any time using the video hash.

## 🏛️ Monorepo Architecture

AuthentiScan is organized as a unified monorepo to ensure tight integration between the forensic engine and the blockchain layer.

    end
    subgraph "Frontend (Next.js 14)"

## 🔒 Security & Trust Model

### 1. Client-Side Cryptography
AuthentiScan prioritizes user privacy and data integrity.
- **Privacy:** Video files never leave the client's machine. Only the calculated **SHA-256 fingerprint** is transmitted to the blockchain.
- **Integrity:** Hashing is performed using the browser's native `SubtleCrypto` API, ensuring resistance against tampering during ingestion.

### 2. On-Chain Immutability
- **Hardened Logic:** Once a verification is anchored to the Stellar ledger, it becomes economically and cryptographically immutable under Stellar consensus assumptions.
- **Authorization:** Every transaction requires a cryptographic signature from a verified auditor using the **Freighter Wallet**. Unauthorized submissions are rejected at the protocol level (`require_auth`).

### 3. Global Unique Protection
- **One Truth:** The smart contract enforces global uniqueness. A specific video hash can only be verified once, preventing conflicting diagnostic reports for the same content.

---

---

## 🛡️ Threat Model & Security Disclosures

AuthentiScan operates under a strictly defined security model designed for transparency and risk awareness.

### 🔐 Security Guarantees

#### 1. Client-Side Hashing Only
- **Privacy:** Video files **never leave the client's browser**. Only the SHA-256 fingerprint is transmitted.
- **Integrity:** Hashing uses the browser's native `SubtleCrypto` API, resistant to tampering.
- **No On-Chain Storage:** The blockchain stores only cryptographic hashes and metadata—never raw video data.

#### 2. Blockchain Immutability
- **Economically** and cryptographically immutable under Stellar consensus assumptions.
- **No Update/Delete:** The smart contract enforces write-once semantics. No `update_verification` function exists.
- **Cryptographic Authorization:** Every transaction requires a signature from the submitter's wallet (`require_auth`).
- **Upgrade Policy:** The current deployment does not implement upgradeability. Any future protocol or contract upgrade would require explicit redeployment and controlled state migration.


#### 3. Global Duplicate Prevention
- **One Hash, One Truth:** The smart contract enforces global uniqueness at the storage layer.
- **Idempotent Behavior:** Re-submitting the same video hash returns the existing `record_id` without creating duplicates.
- **No State Overwrite:** Storage keys use `DataKey::Verification(video_hash)` to prevent collision.

### ⚠️ Known Limitations & Risks

| Risk Factor | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Hash Collisions** | SHA-256 provides a 2^256 address space. Collision probability is considered computationally infeasible with current cryptographic knowledge. | 🟢NEGLIGIBLE |
| **Probabilistic AI** | AI diagnostics are **probabilistic estimates**, not definitive legal proof | 🟡 ACKNOWLEDGED |
| **Frontend Tampering** | Client UI can be modified, but **on-chain records are authoritative** and cryptographically signed | 🟡 MITIGATED |
| **Data Privacy** | No video data stored on-chain; only hashes and metadata | 🟢 PROTECTED |
| **Testnet Keys** | **CRITICAL:** Testnet keys must be rotated before mainnet deployment | 🔴 REQUIRES ACTION |
| **Rate Limiting** | Current demo lacks anti-spam mechanisms | 🟡 FUTURE WORK |

### 🔑 Key Rotation Requirements

> [!WARNING]
> **Testnet → Mainnet Migration:**
> - **NEVER** reuse testnet Stellar keys on mainnet
> - Generate fresh keys using `stellar keys generate --network mainnet`
> - Store mainnet keys in secure vaults (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
> - **NEVER** commit mainnet keys to Git

### 🚀 Production Roadmap

Future production iterations will include:
- **Multi-Signature Consensus:** Require multiple auditor signatures for high-stakes verifications
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent spam and Sybil attacks at the RPC layer
- **Anti-Spam Mechanisms:** Fee-based submission or proof-of-work challenges
- **Decentralized Oracles:** Integrate multi-modal AI models via Chainlink or similar
- **Formal Security Audit:** Mainnet deployment will require independent smart contract audit and security review.

    style L fill:#10b981,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:3px
```

**Key Insight:** Only the **Immutable Core** (Smart Contract + Ledger) provides cryptographic guarantees. The client UI is a convenience layer—**always verify on-chain**.

## 🚀 Developer Quick-Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+) & **npm**
- **Rust Toolchain** (with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target)
- **Stellar CLI** ([Install Guide](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup))
- **Freighter Wallet Extension**

### 2. Smart Contract Setup
```bash
# 1. Build the WASM binary
cd contract
stellar contract build

# 2. Configure network
stellar network add testnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
## 🔬 Forensic Engine (AI Layer)

The current AI diagnostic layer is implemented as a **Forensic Telemetry Engine (Demo Edition)**.
- **Probabilistic Scoring:** Decisions are made based on spectral and spatial probability distributions.
- **Verification Metadata:** The confidence score represents the model's certainty at the time of ingestion.
- **Production Note:** A production-ready environment would integrate multi-modal deepfake detectors (Vision Transformers, Audio-Spectral Analysis) via decentralized oracles.

---

# 3. Deploy
stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet --fund
stellar contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/video_verification.wasm --source deployer --network testnet
```
*Note: Save the returned **Contract ID** for the frontend setup.*

### 3. Frontend Launch
1.  **Config:** Create `frontend/.env.local`
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID=YOUR_CONTRACT_ID
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
    ```
2.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

## ⚖️ Forensic Accuracy Notice

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AI analysis is **probabilistic** and does not constitute definitive legal proof of authenticity. Final judgment should be supported by multi-modal forensic evidence. This platform provides the **Infrastructure of Trust**, but humans remain the final auditors.
