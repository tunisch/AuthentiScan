## Action Plan: Research & Refinement

### Internal Verification (Immediate)
*   **Action:** Conduct a clean deployment test of the experimental environment.
*   **Objective:** Confirm that the README setup instructions work flawlessly for new researchers.
*   **Tasks:**
    - [ ] Deploy contract to **Stellar Testnet**.
    - [ ] Verify creation of first **Verification Record**.
    - [ ] Confirm frontend visibility of the anchored **SHA-256 Content Hash**.

### Performance Review (Next 24 Hours)
*   **Action:** Stress test the **SHA-256 Content Hash** calculation in visual-heavy environments.
*   **Objective:** Ensure the browser stays responsive during large file ingestion.

### Architectural Review (Next 48 Hours)
*   **Action:** Internal review of the trust model.
*   **Objective:** Verify that `require_auth` implementations match the architectural goal of verified submissions.

## Technical Roadmap (Future Work)

The following items are currently **planned future enhancements**:

1.  **AI Integration:** Transition from the **Prototype AI Analysis Module** (simulated) to verified forensic inferencing providers.
2.  **Mainnet Preparation:** Research professional security auditing and mainnet-grade key management.
3.  **Semantic Analysis:** Investigate perceptual hashing (pHash) as a supplement to the **SHA-256 Content Hash** for identifying visually similar content.
